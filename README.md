# Citizen Quest: Editorial Society

A game about Journalistic Skills and Democracy.

Based on the interactive exhibit [Citizen Quest](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/citizen-quest),
developed by [Imaginary](https://about.imaginary.org/) for [Futurium](https://futurium.de/de/citizen-quest).

## Building

Requires Node.js (v18.19 or greater) and npm.

Run the following from the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the compiled game. This directory can be served by any web
server.

## Themes

The game's theme (which controls the colors and some other aesthetic aspects) can be changed by
overriding or modifying the configuration. Check `extras/config/settings.yml` for the available
themes.
